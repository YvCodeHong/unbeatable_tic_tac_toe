First attempt at an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe using the Minimax Algorithm.

I initially wrote a [Tic Tac Toe game](https://github.com/pelensky/ticTacToe) for two human players in JavaScript and initially planned on extending this game when I chose to take on this challenge.

While researching my options for the AI (and choosing the Minimax Algorithm), I decided it would be easier to start with a new project rather than trying to adapt my previous set up to the algorithm. I also decided to implement this in Ruby due to the built in functions Ruby has that Javascript does not have.

The goal:
*  write an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) program
* user chooses game type (human v. computer, human v. human, or computer v. computer)
* computer player should never lose and should win whenever possible
* user should also have the choice of which player goes first
